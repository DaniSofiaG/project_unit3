![The Wonderful World of Japanâ€™s Incredible Convenience Stores](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111941990/218233255-1c0c1ab4-c711-4ab8-b310-7a1c23530967.jpeg)


# Criteria A: Planning


## Problem definition
Meisa is the manager of a convenience store. Last year while doing the end of year report for the store in Decedmber she realized how tiering and disorganized was the process. It took her nearly 2 weeks to collect all the data she needed from excels document, receipts, memory and paper inverntories. Its also come to her attention that a lot of her staff struggles to put record the data properly because of the amount of different methods they have to learn and becuase of how tideous it is. This year she wants things to be different, that's why she's asked for a program that allows her to store and manage all the important data like product, supplier, aisles and staff information. She also has to be able to add or change data as the year goes on. The program has to be simple to use and choherent so that all staff is able to use it.



## Proposed Solution
---

**Design statement**
I wiil design and make a program that manages the data of a convenience store for Meisa. The program will allow Meisa to store and manage all important information related to products, suppliers, aisle and staff. The data will be stred in one program to avoid disorganization and other difficulties like last year. Te program will be constructed with with human disign as a foucus, making it easy for everyone working at the store to ouse and manage the data. The program will be made using the software Python and will be evaluated based on criteria A, B, C and D. It will take aopproixmately 4 weeks to complete and will allow Mesia to add or change data as the year progresses. The program will be designed to be simple, coherent and effective in managing the sore's data, ensureing a more organized and efficient end of year report process. 

## Success Criteria

1. The client can register a new account
2. The client can log in to the application by using the information the previously registered.
3. The program automatically hashes the users passowrd information.
4. The program can store the information of items sold in tables by cateogories such as type, company, name, id, etc.
5. The user can edit the tables by deleting, adding or updating information.
6. The app uses databases to store information.
7. The app has easy to understand labels and interface to make it easier for the client Meisa to implement it as her store.
