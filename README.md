# Criteria A: Planning


## Problem definition
Meisa is the manager of a convenience store. Last year while doing the end of year report for the store in Decedmber she realized how tiering and disorganized was the process. It took her nearly 2 weeks to collect all the data she needed from excels document, receipts, memory and paper inverntories. Its also come to her attention that a lot of her staff struggles to put record the data properly because of the amount of different methods they have to learn and becuase of how tideous it is. This year she wants things to be different, that's why she's asked for a program that allows her to store and manage all the important data like product, supplier, aisles and staff information. She also has to be able to add or change data as the year goes on. The program has to be simple to use and choherent so that all staff is able to use it.



## Proposed Solution
---

**Design statement**

I will design and make a program that manages the data of a convenience store for Meisa. The program will allow Meisa to store and manage all important information related to products, suppliers, aisles, and staff. The data will be stored in a centralized system to avoid the difficulties and disorganization experienced by Meisa last year. The program will be constructed using a user-friendly interface, making it easy for all staff members to use and manage the data. The program will be made using the software Python and will be evaluated based on criteria A, B, C and D. It will take approximately 4 weeks to complete and will consist of features that allow Meisa to add or change data as the year progresses. The program will be designed to be simple, coherent, and effective in managing the store's data, ensuring a more organized and efficient end of year report process.
