![The Wonderful World of Japanâ€™s Incredible Convenience Stores](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111941990/218233255-1c0c1ab4-c711-4ab8-b310-7a1c23530967.jpeg)


# Criteria A: Planning


## Problem definition
Meisa is the manager of a convenience store. Last year while doing the end of year report for the store in Decedmber she realized how tiering and disorganized was the process. It took her nearly 2 weeks to collect all the data she needed from excels document, receipts, memory and paper inverntories. Its also come to her attention that a lot of her staff struggles to put record the data properly because of the amount of different methods they have to learn and becuase of how tideous it is. This year she wants things to be different, that's why she's asked for a program that allows her to store and manage all the important data like product, supplier, aisles and staff information. She also has to be able to add or change data as the year goes on. The program has to be simple to use and choherent so that all staff is able to use it.



## Proposed Solution
---

**Design statement**
I wiil design and make a program that manages the data of a convenience store for Meisa. The program will allow Meisa to store and manage all important information related to products, suppliers, aisle and staff. The data will be stred in one program to avoid disorganization and other difficulties like last year. Te program will be constructed with with human disign as a foucus, making it easy for everyone working at the store to ouse and manage the data. The program will be made using the software Python and will be evaluated based on criteria A, B, C and D. It will take aopproixmately 4 weeks to complete and will allow Mesia to add or change data as the year progresses. The program will be designed to be simple, coherent and effective in managing the sore's data, ensureing a more organized and efficient end of year report process. 

## Success Criteria

1. The solution has a secure registration and login system with secure passwords that all staff in the store can use and create an account in.
2. The solution provides the information of all the products inside the sotre, base on features like:
3. The solution stores and all relevant informaton about the staff of the stores 
4. The application has a page dedicated to assigning, deleting and editing tasks for each staff member.

The solution provides a visual representation of the Humidity and Temperature values inside a dormitory (Local) and outside the house (Remote) for a period of minimum 48 hours. 
2. ```[HL]``` The local variables will be measure using a set of 4 sensors around the dormitory.
3. The solution provides a mathematical modelling for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations. ```(SL: linear model)```, ```(HL: non-lineal model)```
4. The solution provides a comparative analysis for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations including mean, standad deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.
5. ```(SL)```The Local samples are stored in a csv file and ```(HL)``` posted to the remote server.
6. Create a prediction the subsequent 12 hours for both temperature and humidity.
7. A poster summarizing the visual representations, model and analysis is created and communicated. (Should include a study of health levels)
